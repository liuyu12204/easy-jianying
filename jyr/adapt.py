"""Set up an app version that is not in jyr's version table yet.

The only version-specific thing jyr needs is the timeline schema
(draft_info.new_version) the app writes.

- JianYing: read its version (Info.plist on macOS, the install dir / registry on
  Windows); use the newest schema jyr knows. Open one built draft in JianYing to
  confirm it loads.
- CapCut: its drafts are plain JSON, so read the schema from drafts this exact
  CapCut version saved (create one blank project first if there is none).

The result is saved to ~/.jyr/profiles.json.
