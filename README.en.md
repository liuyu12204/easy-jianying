# Easy JianYing

**Tell your AI what to cut. Get a real, editable JianYing (剪映) project back.**

Transitions, keyframes, subtitles, beat-sync, talking-head rough cuts — all as native JianYing tracks you can drag and tweak, then finish in JianYing.

## Why a draft, not a finished video

AI-made videos are often one or two details away from done: a typo in a subtitle, a shot half a second too long, music a bit too loud.

With a finished video, every fix means going back to the AI, regenerating and re-rendering — more waiting, more compute, and no guarantee the result is what you wanted. With a JianYing draft, you open JianYing, fix the subtitle, trim the clip and finish.

| Fix one typo | Finished video | JianYing draft |
|---|---|---|
| How | Regenerate and re-render | Double-click the subtitle in JianYing |
| Wait | Another full render | Seconds |
| Compute | Spent again | None |

> **AI writes the edit plan → we generate a native JianYing draft → you open it and fine-tune.**

## What it does

| | Feature | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| 🎬 | **Generate drafts** | Multi-track, chop, speed, transitions, keyframes, PiP, text, subtitles, stickers, effects, filters, music fades, images/GIF |
| ✂️ | **Talking-head rough cut** | Cuts dead air, fillers, stutters and false starts; then an agent drops the sentence you said twice |
| 💬 | **Auto subtitles** | Local speech recognition (nothing uploaded) → JianYing's native caption track |
| 🥁 | **Beat sync** | Detects the beat, cuts footage on it, adds JianYing beat markers |
| 📦 | **Batch** | One template × one spreadsheet = N drafts |
| 🎨 | **Auto picks** | `"auto"` transitions / effects / fonts, chosen from free resources only |
| 👑 | **Member resources** | JianYing members add `--member` and the AI can use paid transitions, masks, text animations |
| 🌏 | **CapCut** | The same plan makes a CapCut draft |

You open, fine-tune and render the draft in JianYing / CapCut; paid features follow the app's own rules.

## Free users get free resources, members get theirs

Transitions, effects, stickers and fonts are the app's own resources: a draft only names them by ID, and the app downloads the files.

JianYing records in each draft folder's `key_value.json` whether a resource it used is paid (`is_vip`). Easy JianYing marks all 375 built-in cards with it: **175 free** (`is_vip` 0, or fonts bundled with JianYing), 67 paid, 133 with no record.

- **By default only free ones are used**: 116 stickers, 28 effects, 23 fonts, 5 transitions, 1 animation, 1 filter, 1 audio effect. `"auto"` only picks from these.
- **If you are a JianYing member**, add `--member` (or `"member": true` in the plan) and paid or unrecorded resources can be named too — paid transitions, masks, text animations. The build warns which ones are paid.
- Once the draft is open, JianYing applies its own membership rules as usual; jyr does not get around any check.

## Tested versions

jyr writes ordinary JSON draft files; the apps open, edit, save and render them as usual.

| App | Tested | Create drafts | Read / SRT / edit a copy |
|---|---|:---:|:---:|
| JianYing Pro (macOS) | 11.7.0 | ✅ | only drafts jyr built that JianYing has not saved yet |
| JianYing Pro (Windows) | 11.7.0 | ✅ | only drafts jyr built that JianYing has not saved yet |
| CapCut (macOS) | 9.4.1 | ✅ | ✅ (CapCut drafts are plain JSON) |
| CapCut (Windows) | 9.1.0 | ✅ | ✅ (CapCut drafts are plain JSON) |

Other versions are untested. After a JianYing update run `jyr adapt`, then open one built draft to confirm.

## CapCut

Same plan, add `--app capcut`, get a CapCut draft:

```bash
jyr --app capcut doctor
jyr --app capcut build examples/capcut.plan.json --out /tmp/cc-demo --publish --name "my first CapCut draft"
jyr --app capcut inspect "my first CapCut draft"   # read, write SRT, edit a copy
```

With only one of the two apps installed, `--app` is optional; with both, JianYing is the default. On the CapCut side the tool **only reads and writes draft files**; it uses nothing inside CapCut and never touches its UI.

CapCut's resource IDs only partly match JianYing's, so it has its own list. Built in are mostly CapCut's bundled fonts; anything you have used once in CapCut becomes usable after `jyr --app capcut catalog scan`. Same rules as JianYing: free by default, CapCut Pro users add `--member` for Pro resources; `catalog list --free` lists only free ones.

## Quick start

macOS or Windows + JianYing Pro (or CapCut), Python 3.10+, ffmpeg.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YeJe-cpu/easy-jianying && cd easy-jianying
pip install -e '.[asr,fonts]'
jyr doctor
./tools/make_fixtures.sh examples/media
jyr build examples/showcase.plan.json --out /tmp/jyr-demo --publish --name "my first AI draft"
```

Quit JianYing before publishing; the new draft appears first on its home screen. Plan reference: [docs/plan-format.md](docs/plan-format.md). Agent skills: [`skills/`](skills/).

## How we checked it

1. **Every feature was looked at in JianYing.** Real footage, opened, played and rendered in JianYing, checked by eye. Records: [docs/acceptance.md](docs/acceptance.md).
2. **Missing effects get downloaded by JianYing.** Delete a transition's or font's cache and JianYing fetches it again by ID when the draft opens.
3. **The rough cut is graded against a human editor.** On a 316 s raw take, the human cut was 232 s. Rules alone gave 250 s and kept 99% of what the human kept; one agent pass got it to 242 s.
4. **The beat sync is frame-accurate.** On a metronome at 90–150 BPM: tempo error ≤1.5%, beat position off by 2 ms on average and 5 ms at most.
5. **Built for agents.** Times are in seconds, clips chain automatically, resources go by their UI names, and errors list the options that are available.

## Limits

macOS and Windows: tested on an Intel Mac with JianYing 11.7 and CapCut 9.4.1, and on Windows with JianYing 11.7 and CapCut 9.1.0. Apple Silicon should work but hasn't been tested. jyr only writes draft files and never operates the apps' UI — opening, editing and rendering happen in the app. jyr does not read drafts JianYing has saved (CapCut drafts it can read). Only free resources are used unless you declare membership with `--member`; JianYing's membership rules apply either way. Whether CapCut downloads a missing effect by ID, as JianYing does, has not been checked on another machine yet. Not yet supported: crop, chroma key, color grading, curve speed, styled text and audio effects. **Unofficial; not affiliated with ByteDance.** JianYing's / CapCut's terms of use apply.
